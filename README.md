# Computer-Game-and-Simulation

This is the repository for the 2021-2022 year Future Buisness Leaders of America (FBLA) Computer Game and Simulation competition. We hope for a fun year filled with learning. This is a group of 3 people. 2 of whom are new to Coding. Throughout this season, Vidyoot Senthil will be using Unity, and the rest of his team (Sahil Veervalli and Albert Han) will be using godot and will be experimenting with pygame.
